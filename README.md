○ What are your key takeaways from this exercise?

My key takeaway for this exercise is the importance of hierarchy and organization in practicing frontend development. It is important to know the division of each section to be accurate with their style and alignment, and to also maximize the potential of CSS and HTML in creating a user-friendly page. For me, it was easier to draw each division on paper before coding.
